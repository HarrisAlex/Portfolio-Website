                        <p>I am very proud of this render, and I genuinely believe that I have achieved photorealism in some areas of this image, namely the bottom left of the render. Of course, there are plenty of aspects of this render that could use some refinement. I experimented with a couple different textures for the sky, and I wish I had settled on a different one than used in this final render. Throughout this project, I also switched back and forth between having a wall around 20 feet away from the camera that would block the view beyond and having a wall much farther away, and I believe now that this render would have been improved with the presence of a closer wall rather than a semi-infinite alley. I believe the biggest giveaway that this render is CGI is the very obvious repetition in the puddles, the trash bins, and the streetlamps, which all would have been naturally resolved with the inclusion of the closer wall. I also notice now that there are no signs of water anywhere besides the ground, except for maybe on the tile wall on the close right.</p>
